# Normal mode

Think of normal mode as Vim's default state. Vim starts in normal mode, and if you're using Vim properly, normal mode is what you'll naturally fall back to when editing.

To get into normal mode, _hit the escape key_. No matter where you are in Vim, you can generally keep hitting escape to get back into the familiar normal mode.
