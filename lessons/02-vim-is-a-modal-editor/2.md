# The meaning of "modal"

So, what exactly _is_ a modal editor?

A modal editor provides different modes of operation, each suited for a particular purpose. For example, in Vim, there are modes for entering keyboard commands, inserting text, and selecting text.

This is different from non-modal (or modeless) editors, which only provide one mode for inputting characters.

**Click on the editor and try typing your name**. It probably doesn't do what you expect. That's because Vim starts in _normal_ mode, which is used for inputting editing commands, not _insert_ mode, which is what we use to insert text.

This is unlike what we're used to, but it does actually make sense.

With modal editors:

- every key on the keyboard can have a specialised meaning, which varies by mode
- keyboard commands can be composed, which means that Vim has fewer awkward 'chorded' shortcuts like "ctrl+shift+r"
- different modes can optimise the use of the keyboard so that your fingers stay near the home row
