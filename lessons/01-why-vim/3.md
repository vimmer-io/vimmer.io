# Vim is terminal-first

GUIs are useful, and both Vim and Neovim have a some of their own. But you might find yourself in an environment where it's not possible or practical to use one. Sometimes, it's a lot easier to reach for a command-line editor, like when you're connected to a remote machine via SSH or you're attached to a Docker container.

You can scale Vim up to the level of an IDE or GUI editor, but you _can't_ typically scale an IDE or GUI editor down to a command-line interface. When you find yourself in a situation where a GUI isn't suitable, Vim has got your back.
