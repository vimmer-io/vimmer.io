# Vim is keyboard-first

Nothing in Vim requires you to use the mouse. You can do absolutely everything from the keyboard.

This sounds daunting at first, but once you've integrated some of the keymaps into muscle memory you'll see your productivity skyrocket. Reaching for the mouse, even if only rarely, breaks your flow. And those little breaks can add up over time.

For some people, a keyboard-driven workflow is crucial to prevent RSI symptoms. If you struggle with RSI, it might be worth giving Vim a shot.

### Note

Vim has mouse support, but most people rarely use it.
