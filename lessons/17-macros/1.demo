To record a macro, type:

    q<macro name>

So, to record a macro called 'a', type:

    qa

Then make some edits!

When you've finished making the edits, hit the q key again to stop
recording.

All of the keystrokes that you made during the recording period will
be saved, and we'll learn how to replay them again in the next
section.
