# Appending to macros

Sometimes, you'll record a macro and then think to yourself "damn â€” I forgot to do this small thing at the end". If this happens, _you don't have to re-record the entire macro_. You can _append_ additional steps to the macro by recording to the _uppercase register_ where it's stored!

So, if your macro was originally recoded with `qa`, you can re-enter recording mode but _append_ to the macro that you recorded previously with `qA`.

This is useful for the common situation where you only need to make a small change at the end of the macro's sequence of actions.

**Try it in the editor.** First, try recording a macro into the `"a` register with `qa`. Make the macro prefix the line with `XXX`. Then stop recording.

Try re-running the macro a few times to get a clear idea of what it's doing.

Then, start appending to the `"a` register macro with `qA`. This time, add `XXX` to the _end_ of the line, and stop recording.

If you re-run your macro with `@a` again, you'll notice that it includes the steps from _both_ of the recording processes. Nice!
