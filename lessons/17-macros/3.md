# What's in a name?

I mentioned in the previous sections that `qa` in normal mode starts recording a macro called `a`. This isn't strictly the truth.

Vim doesn't have a special "data store" for macros. It actually re-uses the [registers that we already know about](https://vimmer.io/lesson/copying-and-pasting)! What I mean by this is: when you start recording a macro using something like `qa`, Vim actually starts recording your macro into the `"a`  register. Once you've finished recording, the `"a` macro will contain the keystrokes that you used.

So really, when you type `qx`, you're actually telling Vim: "start recording a macro into the `"x` register"

**Let's prove it in the editor.** Record a macro into the `"x` register with `qx`. Once you've finished recording, list the `"x` register with `:reg x`. You should notice that the `"x` register contains precisely the keystrokes that you in putted whilst recording.
