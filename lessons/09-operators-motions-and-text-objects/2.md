# The structure of Vim's command language

As we mentioned in the previous section, there are three components:

- operators
- text objects
- motions

We'll explore what each of these are in the coming sections, but for now, we should understand that the basic structure of Vim's command language is:

    [count]{operator}{text object/motion}

That means, in normal mode:

- we can start our request with an optional count
- we then specify an _operator_
- we then specify either a _text object_ or a _motion_

When we perform such an action in normal mode, we perform the given operator `count` times over the range of characters specified by either the text object or motion.

**Let's try an example to kick us off.** We need to know about the `d` operator and the `ap` text object (we'll learn exactly what is meant by 'operator' and 'text object' next). The `d` operator is one of the simplest, used for deleting text. The `ap` text object corresponds to a paragraph. Therefore, `dap` says to Vim 'delete a paragraph' â€” the paragraph being the one which the cursor is placed on.

**Try it in the editor.**
