# Motions

A motion is any command that moves the cursor. We've learned a lot of these implicitly throughout the course so far. We know that `gg` takes us to the top of the file — that's a motion. We know that `w` lets us jump from word to word — also a motion. We also know that we can use `fX` to jump to the next `X` on the line — again, it's a motion!

Motions can be used in conjunction with operators. When you combine an operator with a motion — like `dt;` from the first section in this lesson — the operator is applied over the _area_ that the motion covers.

**Let's experiment**. In the editor, try combining any of the operators we know with the motions we've picked up throughout the course.
