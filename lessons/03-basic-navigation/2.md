# Navigating to specific lines

We might find ourselves wanting to jump to the very top, very bottom, or to some specific line in a file. Vim provides us with some commands for doing this.

If you want to jump to the top of your file to, you can do this by typing `gg` in normal mode. Give it a try in the editor.

If you want to jump to the bottom of your file, you can do this by typing `G` in normal mode. Try this in the editor.

Other times, you either know exactly which line you want to jump to or you can visually see it on screen. For example: most compilers will tell you which line an error is on if your build fails. With Vim, you can jump directly to the line of interest — say line 10 — by hitting `10G` in normal mode.
