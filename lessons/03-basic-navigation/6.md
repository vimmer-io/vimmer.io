# Jumping to matching characters

Certain characters come in opening and closing pairs. For example `()`, `{}`, and `[]`.

Sometimes, you'll want to jump from the opening character to the closing character, or vice-versa. Vim has a command for that: `%` in normal mode.

There's some matching bracket pairs set up for you in the editor. Try using `%` to jump between them.
