# Using a count to repeat motions

All the things we've learned in the past few sections can be described as 'motions'. A motion is any command that moves the cursor

Some motions can be supplied with a count, which usually tells Vim how many times to repeat the movement. For example, the `j` command (for moving the cursor downwards) accepts a count with tells it how many positions to move the cursor. If you type `10j`, Vim will move the cursor ten lines down.

Give it a try in the editor. You should also try experimenting with `f`, `F`, and `;`.
