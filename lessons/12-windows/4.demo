This file is called "demo".

There are some other files on the filesystem:

- foo.txt
- bar.txt
- baz.txt

Try opening them using a combination of split commands. For example, try
something like:

    :split foo.txt
    :split bar.txt
    :vsplit baz.txt

Then, try closing the windows when you're done with them using either:

    :q
    :close
