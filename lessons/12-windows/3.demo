Try using :split/:vsplit a few times to create some windows that are all
peering into this buffer.

For example, you can run:

    :vsplit
    :split
    :split

...

Once you've got a few windows open, try making an edit -- maybe try typing your
name or deleting a line. You should see your change be reflected in all of the
windows!
