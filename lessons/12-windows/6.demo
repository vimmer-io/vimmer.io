Open up a bunch of windows with some combination of:

    :split
    :vsplit
    <C-w>s
    <C-w>v

then try moving the cursor between windows with these movement commands:

    <C-w>h (move left)
    <C-w>j (move down)
    <C-w>k (move up)
    <C-w>l (move right)

(the arrow keys also work if you don't like hjkl!)
