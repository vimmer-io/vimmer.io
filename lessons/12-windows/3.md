# Two windows, one buffer

I mentioned in the last section that `:split` and `:vsplit` accept a filename. But it turns out that this filename is _actually optional!_

If you don't specify a filename and just run `:split`/`:vsplit`, you'll split the current window into two â€” leaving you with a new window that's peering into the _same_ buffer!

Interesting! You can have multiple windows that are "looking at" the same buffer. This can be really useful: in a large file, you can keep two far-away sections visible on-screen at the same time.

**Try it in the editor!** Use the `:split` or `:vsplit` commands on their own to create a bunch of windows all peering into the `demo` buffer. Then, try making an edit to the buffer. You'll see that your change is reflected in _all_ of the windows.
