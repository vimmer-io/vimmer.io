Try opening some splits a pre-determined size using:

    [count]<C-w>s / <C-w>[count]s
                 or
    [count]<C-w>v / <C-w>[count]v

Then, try resizing those splits with:

    [count]<C-w><
    [count]<C-w>>
    [count]<C-w>+
    [count]<C-w>-

Then, try setting the size for those splits manually with:

    [count]<C-w>|
    [count]<C-w>_

... finally, to get everything back to a sensible windowing configuration, try:

    <C-w>=

... you're a window-resizing machine!
