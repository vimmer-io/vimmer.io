# Closing windows

When you're done with a window, you can close it with `:q` or `:close`.

`:q` is, of course, the same command that you use to quit Vim. If you have more than one window (or tabpage — more on those later), `:q` will _only quit that window_. If there's only one window `:q` will exit Vim.

`:close` does _almost_ the same thing — the only real difference being that it _won't try to quit Vim_ if there's only one window open.

**Give it a try in the editor. The file that's currently open is called `demo`.** On the filesystem, there are three other files called `foo.txt`, `bar.txt`, and `baz.txt`. Like before, open some windows to view these files with with `:split`/`:vsplit` and try closing them with `:q` or `:close`.
