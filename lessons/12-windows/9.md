# Popping up a new window for quick notes

Often, you'll find yourself wanting to pop up a new window quickly to write some scratch notes.

You can do this really quickly in Vim â€” either:

- use the `:new` command, which creates a new split with an empty file open
- use the `<C-w>n` mapping in normal mode, which does the exact same thing

**Give it a go in the editor.** If you're anything like me, you'll find yourself doing this super often!
