# Moving windows around

You can move windows around so as to arrange them nicely on screen. There are many maps for doing this — I find the most useful ones are:

- `<C-w>H` — move the current window all the way to the left.
- `<C-w>J` — move the current window all the way to the bottom.
- `<C-w>K` — move the current window all the way to the top.
- `<C-w>L` — move the current window all the way to the right.

... look, it's our old friend `hjkl` again! This time, you use the capital letters `HJKL` with our window prefix `<C-w>` to move the windows around. These ones are super useful if you want to turn a horizontal split into a vertical split, or vice-versa.

Some other useful ones are:

- `<C-w>x` — exchange the current window with the next one, or the previous window if no next window exists.
- `<C-w>r` — 'rotate' the windows around.

**Let's try these in the editor.** To make things easy for you, I've left a bunch of files on the filesystem. You should just be able to type `:args *.txt`, followed by `:all` to open them all up in a bunch of horizontal splits. Then, have a crack at the above bindings!
