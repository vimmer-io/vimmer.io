# Commands for opening new windows

There are lots of ways to open a new window in Vim. Most of the time, opening a new window involves splitting the _current_ window in two â€” either horizontally (two windows on top of each other) or vertically (two windows side-by-side). This is why you'll sometimes hear folks referring to windows as "splits" in the community.

The most basic way of opening a new window is using the split commands. The two simplest are `:split` (for horizontal splits) and `:vsplit` (for vertical splits). We had a brief interaction with the `:split` command in the last section, but now let's dive a bit deeper.

Both `:split` and `:vsplit` accept a filename, which tells Vim to:

1. Load the given file into a new buffer.
2. Split the current window into two.
3. Open the buffer in the new window.

**In the editor, the file that's currently open is called `demo`.** On the filesystem, there are three other files called `a.txt`, `b.txt`, and `c.txt`. Using a combination of `:split` and `:vsplit` commands, try opening some new windows!
