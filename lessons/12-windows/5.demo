This time, instead of using window commands to create/close windows, we're
going to use Vim's built-in window mappings. These are a lot quicker once
you've integrated them into muscle memory.

First, create a few horizontal and vertical splits with:

    <C-w>s
    <C-w>v

Then, once you're done, try closing them down with:

    <C-w>c
