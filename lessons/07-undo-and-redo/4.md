# Time travelling with Vim

`g-` and `g+` are useful, but there's actually a much easier way to recover lost changes like the ones we talked about in the previous section.

Vim has two useful commands for time travelling in the document history: `:earlier` and `:later`. If you want to revert to the way that your document was 10 minutes ago, you can use the command `:earlier 10m`. To get back, use `:later 10m`.

There are a few ways you can use this:

- `:earlier 1` is the same as `g-`, and `:later 1` is the same as `g+`.
- You can use time units like `10s`, `10m`, `10h`, and `10d` for seconds, minutes, hours, and days respectively.
- You can use `:earlier 3f`, for example, to revert to the way that the file looked 3 file writes ago.

**Try this in the editor.** Make a series of changes, wait a short while, and try the `:earlier` and `:later` command.
