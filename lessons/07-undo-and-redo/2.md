# Redo

What good is undo without its trusty companion redo?

You can redo in Vim using `<C-r>` in normal mode — that is, hold control on your keyboard and hit `r`.

Redo is exactly what it says on the tin — it takes you in the _opposite_ direction to undo, toward your more recent edits.

**Give it another go in the editor.** Write a few things, then undo the changes. Use `<C-r>` to walk back to where you were before.
