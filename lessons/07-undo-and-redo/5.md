# Undo persistence

When you close Vim, the tree of undos created for the file that you're working on is usually destroyed. However, it's possible to make Vim's undo functionality _persist_, so that even if you close and re-open Vim, you'll be able to use the undo command to revert the text to what it was before.

If you want to enable this feature, add `set undofile` to your Vim configuration.
