# A better definition

The definition from earlier isn't quite the full story. A better definition would be:
> The global command lets you run an Ex command _from_ each matching line in a range, defined by a regular expression.

The difference is subtle, but there are two key bits:

- the global command, contrary to its name, doesn't have to act _globally_ — you can give it a range, and it'll only consider lines in that range
- the global command doesn't run a command 'against' lines — it literally moves your cursor to the matching line, then runs the Ex command you gave it verbatim (this means that we can change lines _around_ the matched lines by being clever with ranges)

## How does it work?

The algorithm is quite simple:

- you give the global command a _range_, _regular expression_, and an _Ex command_
- the global command then finds all of the lines within your range that match your regular expression and marks them (first pass)
- for each marked line in order, the global command changes your _current line_ to the marked line and executes your command verbatim (second pass)

This two-pass algorithm means that Vim won't get confused about which lines to act on when, for example, adding and deleting lines with `:global`.

Try the global command again on the left. Notice how it leaves your cursor on the last regex match in the buffer! That's because the global command is _physically moving your cursor_ to each match.
