# Useful Ex commands to use with the global command

_Printing_ with the `:print`/`:p` command is the default action for the global command. If you don't specify an Ex command, it's assumed that you mean `:print`.

We can do a lot more than just print, though. Here are some useful Ex commands that you can use in conjunction with `:global`:

- `:delete`/`:d` — used to delete a line — for example, `:g/foo/d` will delete all lines matching `foo`
- `:move`/`:m` — can be used to move a line to a particular address — for example, `:g/foo/m 0` will move all lines matching `foo` to the start of the file
- `:copy`/`:t` — can be used to copy a line to a particular address — for example, `:g/foo/t 0` will move all lines matching `foo` to the start of the file
- `:norm ...` — can be used to execute some normal mode commands on a line — for example, `:g/foo/norm Abar` will append `bar` to all lines matching `foo`

... plus many more.

_Any Ex command_ can be used in conjunction with the global command, so feel free to use your imagination. In my experience, though, the ones listed above are the most useful.

**Let's try this in the editor.** Use the global command to delete all of the lines matching `foo` with `:g/foo/d`.
