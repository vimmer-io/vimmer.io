# The global command as a poor man's quickfix list

You can use `Q` in normal mode to enter Ex mode. Nobody really uses it any more, and it's mostly there for compatibility. Most people remap `Q` to nothing in normal mode to avoid getting dropped into Ex mode by mistake â€” which I think is fair.

But Ex mode does have _one_ interesting trick still going for it. If you invoke the global command from within Ex mode and specify `visual` as the command, like this:

```
:g/foo/visual
```

... you can use it as a poor man's quickfix list.

Running that command for the first time will drop you in normal mode on the first matching line. Re-entering Ex mode will automatically jump you to the next match

This isn't always useful, but it's occasionally handy when you want to perform a manual edit on each line, followed by some commands, for a number of lines in the file.

For example:

```
:g/foo/visual | w
```

That'll allow you to perform manual edits on each line matching `foo`, and when you re-enter Ex mode to jump to the next match, Vim will automatically save the buffer for you.
