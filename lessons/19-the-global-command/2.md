# The inverse global command

The global command has a cousin, called the inverse global command or `:vglobal`, that does something slightly different.

The global command finds all of the lines in buffer that match a regular expression and performs an Ex command them.

The _inverse global command_ finds all of the lines in a buffer that _do not_ match a regular expression and performs an Ex command on those.

You can think of the global command as _selecting_ the lines that match a regular expression, whereas the inverse global commands _filters out lines that don't match_.

It works in the exact same way as `:global`/`:g` — you just use `:vglobal`/`:v` instead.

**Let's try this in the editor.** Once again, a secret message is hidden amongst the `HAYSTACK` lines. This time, secret messages lines aren't uniquely identified by anything — so you'll have to _filter out_ the `HAYSTACK` lines and print whatever's left. You can do this with the `:v` command.

Once again, if you're really stuck, jump to the bottom of the buffer to see how it's done.
