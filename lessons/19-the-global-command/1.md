# What is the global command?

Most explanations of what the global command does go something like this:

> The global command lets you run a command against a set of lines defined by a regular expression

This is a good approximation, and will help us get started. In its most basic form, you can think of the global command as a tool for saying "run a command against all lines in the buffer matching a regular expression".

With this in mind, here's the syntax for basic use of the global command:

```
:global /regular_expression/ ex_command
```

`:global` here can be shortened to `:g`, and the whitespace outside of the regular expression is not significant. The following form is equivalent:

```
:g/regular_expression/ex_command
```

It's worth noting that the `ex_command` at the end is optional; if you don't specify it, it'll default to `:print`/`:p`, which is used to print a line in the buffer.

Therefore, we can use something like `:g/foo/p` (or the shorter form `:g/foo`) to print all of the lines matching `foo` in the buffer.

Now the we understand the core concept of the global command, **let's try it out**. In the editor, there is a message hidden among the `HAYSTACK` lines. The lines containing parts of the secret message always starts with the `X` character. Given this clue, try using the global command to print all of the lines starting with an `X` to uncover the hidden message!
