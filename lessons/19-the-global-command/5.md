# Chaining global commands

Global commands can be chained in Vim. That means the Ex command you pass to a `:global` invocation can be _another_ `:global` invocation. This sounds a bit crazy, but think about the following examples:

- `:g/test/g/run` — prints all of the lines matching both `test` and `run`
- `:g/foo/v/bar` — prints all lines containing `foo`, but not `bar`
- `:g/foo/v/bar/g/baz` — prints all lines containing `foo` and `baz`, but not `bar`

To give you some ideas, I've used this is the past to:

- delete all debugging print statements that I've not explicitly marked with the string `KEEPME` (hint: `:g/print/v/KEEPME/d`)
- list all of the type definitions in a file that don't contain `GET` in their name (hint: `:g/^type/v/GET/`)
- slowly whittle down what I'm grepping for in a file by chaining more global commands — I think this is a bit easier to cognitively manage than writing a more complex regex

The only limitation with using the global command recursively is that you can only specify a range for the _first_ invocation of `:global`. As in, you can't do this:

```
:g/foo/-10,+10g/bar/d
```

Thankfully the situations where you'd ever need this are extremely rare.

**Let's give this a try in the editor.** Try deleting all of the lines that contain `foo`, but _not_ `bar`, using a chained global command in the editor.
