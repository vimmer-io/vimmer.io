# Jumping with precision

So far, we've been using `'a` to jump to the `a` mark. If you are incredibly observant, you might have noticed that this only jumps us to the _line_ where the mark is set. This is fine for most use cases, but for the rare few times when you _do_ need more precision, Vim's got you covered.

You can use the backtick key `` ` `` followed by the mark — for example, `` `a `` — to jump to the exact row _and_ column where a mark is set.

**Let's try this.** Set the `'a`, `'b`, and `'c` marks with `ma`, `mb`, and `mc` as usual. But this time, jump to them using the `` ` `` key instead of the `'` key.
