# Special marks: last change

Vim has a few special marks that are worth knowing about. You don't have to manually set these marks — Vim does it for us — but they're often useful targets for jumping to.

The first special mark is `'.`, representing the _last change_ in the current buffer. If you make any change, then move away from it, you can jump _back_ to the place where you made the change with `'.`.

**Let's try this in the editor.** Make any change on the marked line, then hit `G` to go to the bottom of the buffer. Then, try using `'.` to jump back to where you made the change.

**Pro tip:** the notion of jumping back to the last change gets a serious boost when we start looking at the _changelist_ in the next lesson!
