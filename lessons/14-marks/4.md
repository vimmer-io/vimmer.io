# Marks across buffers

Lowercase marks like `'a` and `'b` are local to the buffer you're currently in. This is nice, because it means that different buffers can have a completely different set of marks. But what if we want to set marks that move us _between_ buffers? It's much more common in a large codebase to want to jump _between_ files rather than to different places in the same file.

Vim's got our back. _Capital letters_, when used as marks, mean _global marks_. For example, the `'A` mark not only represents the row and column where it was set, but the _file_ too!

So, you can set a mark with `mA` and jump back to it from _any buffer_ with `'A` (or, as we just learned, `` `A ``).

**Let's try this in the editor.** We're going to work with two buffers this time. Set the `'A` mark in the initial buffer with `mA`, then edit the `marky` file with `:e marky`. Then set the `'B` mark in the `marky` file.

Once you're done, try hitting `'A` and `'B` to jump between the two buffers!

**Hint:** remember that the capital letter is how Vim knows we're speaking about a global mark.
