# User-defined marks

In the last section, I lied a little bit.

I said that we can set 'a mark' with `mm`. This is _true_, but we can also set a mark with `ma`. And `mb`. And `mc`!

You get the idea. Vim gives us a unique mark for every letter in the alphabet! This means that you can set as many marks as you'd like, for each different letter, and jump between them with `'a`, `'b`, etc.

I like to choose letters that have some _meaning_ relevant to where they're placed. For example, I often use the `'w` mark to keep track of where I'm currently **w**orking. I also use the `'i` mark to store the location of something I think might be **i**nteresting.

**Let's experiment in the editor.** Try setting marks `'a`, `'b`, and `'c` on the specified lines with `ma`, `mb`, and `mc` respectively. Then try jumping between them with `'a`, `'b`, and `'c`.
