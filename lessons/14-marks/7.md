# Special marks: visual selection

We've already met the `gv` command, which allows us to reselect our previous visual selection. When we use `gv`, how does Vim know where the last visual selection was?

The answer is that Vim sets the `'<` and `'>` registers to remember the last visual selection. This is useful to know â€” it means we can jump to the _start_ of the last visual selection with `'<`, and the _end_ with `'>`.

**Give this a try in the editor.** Make a visual selection, then re-enter normal mode. You can then use `'<` and `'>` to jump to the start and end of the visual selection you made.
