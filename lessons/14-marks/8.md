# Special marks: sentences and paragraphs

The `'{` and `'}` marks in Vim represent the start and the end of the current paragraph respectively.

In a similar vein, `'(` and `')` marks in Vim represent the start and the end of the current sentence respectively.

You can use these marks, but you're probably better off just using Vim's built-in `{` and `}` motion for paragraphs and `(` and `)` for sentence.

So why are they useful? They're useful in _Ex commands_. We haven't gone into much depth on Ex commands just yet, but trust me, these marks are useful in some circumstances with things like the global command.

**Give it a go in the editor.**
