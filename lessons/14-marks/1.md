# Marks

Marks in Vim are kind of like bookmarks. They are used to tag a location in your document that you might want to return to later.

Vim has two types of marks: marks that are manually set by _you_, and marks that are automatically set by the editor. Both types are useful in different situations.

As an example of where you might use marks, consider the following situation: you're trawling through a codebase hunting for a bug, and you've just spotted a function that warrants some further analysis. But before you start debugging that function, there's a few other places you'd like to look first â€” perhaps further down the call stack, or elsewhere in the current buffer.

In this kind of situation, it would be a good idea to set a mark on the interesting function so that you can easily return to it. Setting a mark means that returning to the interesting function is just _two keystrokes!_ That's much easier than finding it again by scratch, or grepping for it.

So, how do we set a mark? For now, we're going to consider just two keymaps:

- `mm` sets the mark
- `'m` jumps us back to the line where the mark is set

**Let's try this in the editor**. Place a mark on the line where the interesting function starts with `mm`, then jump to the bottom of the buffer with `G`. Then, try jumping back to the interesting function with `'m`.
