# Useful address specifiers

There are a few useful address specifiers that are well worth remembering. These are:

- `.`, which represents the current line
- `$`, which represents the last line in the file — for example, `:$d` deletes the last line in the buffer
- `'t`, which represents the line that mark `t` is set to
- `/foo/`, which represents the next line where `foo` matches (relative to the cursor position) — for example, `:/foo/d` deletes the next line where the text `foo` appears
- `?foo?`, which represents the previous line where `foo` matches (relative to the cursor position) — for example, `:?foo?d` deletes the previous line where the text `foo` appears
- You can offset an address with a positive or negative number, e.g. `:+1d` deletes the line one below the cursor, and `:-1d` deletes the line one before the cursor

You can also _chain_ these specifiers for some interesting results. For example:

- `:/foo/+2d` deletes the line that is two lines _below_ the next match of `foo`
- `:0/import/d` deletes the first line in the buffer that contains the word `import`
- `:/foo/?bar?d` jumps to the next match of `foo`, then jumps _back_ from there to the previous match of `bar`, then deletes that line

**Have a play with these in the editor.** The `:delete` command accepts any of these address, so give it a try.
