# Visual mode and the range operator

By now, we've probably seen this thing a few times: `'<,'>`

What does _that_ mean?!

We can decipher that now. First, understand that Vim uses the `<` and `>` marks to represent the start and end of a visual selection respectively. If you highlight a range of lines, the `<` mark will be placed at the start of your visual selection and the `>` mark the end.

Now recall that `'t` is an address specifier that specifies the line of mark `t`.

Putting these two facts together, we understand that `'<,'>` is a range that represents the current (or previous) visual selection! That's why, if you're in visual mode and you type `:`, Vim will pre-populate the command line with `'<,'>`. It's because most of the time, if you're issuing an Ex command from visual mode, you want to act over the selected region.

**Let's try to convince ourselves of this in the editor.** Visually select the first paragraph, then re-enter normal mode. Then type `:'<,'>d` manually into the command line. The paragraph gets deleted, even though we're no longer in visual mode any more! That's because Vim preserves the `'<` and `'>` marks, even if you're no longer in visual mode.
