# Basic Ex commands

You issue Ex commands using the Vim command line, accessed through `:` in normal mode. Many of the commands that you use on a day-to-day basis might be inherited Ex commands.

To show you how ubiquitous they are: if you know how to write a buffer to a file in Vim (hint: `:w`), congratulations! You've been using Ex commands all along. To be precise, `:w` is an Ex command that is usually used to write the contents of the buffer to a file.

There are lots of Ex commands — far too many to enumerate here — but here are a few that are useful time and time again:
- `:print`, or just `:p` for short, is used to print a line to Vim's output
- `:move`, or just `:m` for short, is used to move a line/range from a source to a target
- `:copy`, or just `:t` for short, is used to copy a line/range from a source to a target
- `:delete`, or just `:d` for short, is used to delete a line/range
- `:yank`, or just `:y` for short, is used to yank a line/range to a register
- `:put` is used to put the contents of a register

**Give this a try in the editor.** For each of the lines, give the commands above a test drive.
