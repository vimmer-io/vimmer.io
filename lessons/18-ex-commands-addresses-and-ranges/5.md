# Default ranges

If you don't remember ever having encountered addresses and ranges before, don't worry; Ex commands have _default_ addresses and ranges, so most of the time you don't have to think about the lines a command acts over. Without passing a range to a command, Vim _generally_ does the intuitive thing. For example, the default range for the `:d` (delete line) command is `.` â€” so running `:d` on its own will delete the line under the cursor.

This leads us to an interesting fact: did you know that the `:w` command accepts a range? The default range for `:w` is all of the lines in the file. That makes sense; when you're using `:w`, you typically want to write the entire buffer content to disk. But if you were so inclined, you could specify a range to write a just one section of the file to disk. For example, `:1,10w foo` will write lines `1` through `10` to a file called `foo`. This can be useful if you have a large file that you want to break up into smaller sub-files.
