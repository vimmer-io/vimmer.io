This is the first paragraph. Visually select it, then re-enter normal mode.
Then, try manually typing :'<,'>d from normal mode. You'll see that the
paragraph disappears, even though you aren't in visual mode any more!

This is because Vim preserves the values of the '< and '> marks, even if
you're not in visual mode any more. This is useful in some circumstances, and
it's actually instrumental in making the gv keybind work.
