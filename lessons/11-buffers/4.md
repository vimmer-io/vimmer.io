# A slightly easier way to move between buffers

The `:b` command doesn't just accept buffer numbers â€” it also accepts file paths. What's more is that you can use tab completion to get a list of the buffers that are available!

**Let's try this.** This time, we have some files called `foo.txt`, `bar.txt`, and `baz.txt`. Open them with the `:e` command. Once you've got the files loaded into buffers, type `:b` followed by a space, then hit the tab key on your keyboard. You can then use the tab key to walk forward through the list.

## Pro tip

If you want to open `foo.txt`, `bar.txt`, and `baz.txt` all at the same time, you can use `:args *.txt`. We'll learn more about the `:args` command and the arglist in a later lesson.
