# Deleting a buffer

If you like to keep your buffer list nice and tidy, you can use the `:bd` command to delete a buffer from the buffer list. `:bd` by itself will get rid of the _current_ buffer, but just like the `:b` command, you can also specify a buffer number or a file path.

And don't worry â€” if you try to delete a buffer that has unsaved changes, Vim will stop you from proceeding.

**Give it a go**. In the editor, open all of the text files in the current directory with `:args *.txt`. Then, try deleting some of the loaded buffers with `:bd`.
