# Moving between buffers

We've already seen how we can use the `:bn` and `:bp` commands to move sequentially through our buffer list. There are lots of other ways to get around, though!

One way is using the `:buffer` command, or `:b` for short. You might have noticed that the output of `:ls` has a number in the first column. This number is unique to the buffer, and never changes. If you give one of these buffer numbers to the `:b` command — like `:b 1` — Vim will take you to that buffer.

**Give this a try.** Once again, open the `a.txt`, `b.txt`, and `c.txt` files in the editor, and run `:ls`. Then, type `:b <number>` using one of the buffer numbers. You can quickly bounce between buffers like this.
