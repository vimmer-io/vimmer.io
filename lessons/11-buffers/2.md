# Listing your open buffers

It's easy to lose track of which buffers are loaded. So, Vim provides a command for listing them: `:ls`.

**Give this a try in the editor.**

- First, list which buffers are available with `:ls` — you should see that only the `demo` buffer is loaded.
- Then, open the file `a.txt` with `:e a.txt`, and list the buffers again — this time, you should see both `demo` and `a.txt`.
- Repeat the process for `b.txt` and `c.txt`.
