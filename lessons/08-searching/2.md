# Jumping between matches

Once you've made a search, you can jump between matches with the `n` and `N` keys.

- `n` jumps to the next match in the direction that you initiated the search â€” so if you initiated the search with `/`, `n` jumps _forward_ in the document, but if you initiated with `?`, `n` jumps _backwards_.
- `N` jumps to the next match in the _opposite_ direction to what you initiated the search with.

Searches in Vim wrap around by default, so if you're on the last match in the document and you hit `n`, you'll be taken to the _first_ match.

**Try this in the editor.** This time, there are a few `NEEDLE` lines among the `HAYSTACK` lines. Start searching for `NEEDLE`, and then use `n` and `N` to jump between the different matches.
