# Searching for the word under the cursor

If you've got your cursor positioned over an interesting word, you can use the `*` and `#` commands in normal mode to quickly initiate a search for it. This is really useful if the word is long and cumbersome to type â€” like long variable names in code sometimes are.

The difference between `*` and `#` is that `*` will initiate the search in the _forwards_ direction, and `#` will initiate the search going backwards.

**Give it a try.** In the editor, there's a few instances of `HaRd_to_Type_Word` hidden amongst the `HAYSTACK` strings. Use the `*` to initiate a search for `HaRd_to_Type_Word`, then use `n` to jump between them.
