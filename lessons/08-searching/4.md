# Search offsets

Sometimes, the line that you're actually looking for is a few lines above or below the line that you're searching for. If this is the case, you can use a search offset to change where you'll land.

There are two types of search offsets: line offsets and character offsets. Line offsets are generally more useful, so we'll focus on them for now. For line offsets, there are two things to remember:

- prefixing your search with `/+10` will offset your search by ten lines _downwards_
- prefixing your search with `/-10` will offset your search by ten lines _upwards_

For example, to land ten lines above the next line containing `NEEDLE`, you'd type `/NEEDLE/-10`, followed by enter, in normal mode.

**Let's try this in the editor.** There's a special string hidden 300 lines _above_ the `NEEDLE` in the editor. See if you can find it using a search offset!
