# Intelligently setting case sensitivity

Vim has a really nice option for setting case sensitivity _intelligently_. It's called `smartcase`, and it makes your search _case sensitive_ if your search pattern uses uppercase characters.

You can enable it with `:set ignorecase` followed by `:set smartcase` and disable it with `:set nosmartcase`.

**Try it in the editor.**
