# Case insensitive search

By default, Vim searches are _case sensitive_. A search like `/A` will only match `A` characters, not `a`. This behaviour isn't always what you want.

Vim lets use override this with the `ignorecase` option. Use the command `:set ignorecase` to enable it, and `:set noignorecase` to disable it. With this turned on, Vim searches won't be case sensitive.

**Give this a go in the editor.** There's a few `NEEDLE` strings hidden amongst the `HAYSTACK` strings in the editor, but the `NEEDLE` strings are capitalised strangely, so you won't be able to find them with just `/NEEDLE`. You'll first have to enable the `ignorecase` option, then search for `needle` to find them.
