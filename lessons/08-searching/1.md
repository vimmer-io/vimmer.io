# Searching with Vim

Using the search functionality in your text editor is often the fastest way to get where you want — especially if the document you're working in is large.

Vim has an extremely powerful search function that also supports a rich regular expression language. In this lesson, we're going to explore how to actually _perform_ searches. We're going to leave the regular expression stuff for a later lesson, because there's a lot to cover!

There are two ways that you can start a search in Vim: using either the `/` or `?` key in normal mode. Both of these keys enter the search prompt, where you can type in a regular expression or a literal string — the difference is that `/` starts searching _forward_ and `?` starts searching _backwards_.

In both cases, when you're done, hit the enter key to initiate your search and return to normal mode.

**Try this in the editor.** The editor is pre-populated with lines containing the word `HAYSTACK`. Your task is to find the only line containing the word `NEEDLE`. The file is 100,000 lines long, so you _have_ to use search!
