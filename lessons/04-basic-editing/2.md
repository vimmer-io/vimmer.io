# Deleting characters

Another thing that we often need to do is delete stuff.

The simplest deletion is getting rid of a single character. In Vim, there are _two_ normal mode mappings that we should be aware of:

- `x`, which deletes the character underneath the cursor
- `X`, which deletes the character behind the cursor (like backspace)

You can remember this, because `x` is a cross, and we're 'crossing out' a character.

You can use a count with your command — e.g. `5x` — to delete multiple characters at the same time!

In the editor, practice the `x` and `X` commands by removing the extraneous spaces between the words.
