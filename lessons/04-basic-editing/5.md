# Changing within special characters

Now, it's not often that we want to just _delete_ the content within special characters. Usually, we want to _change_ the content â€” as in, get rid of the old stuff and put something new in its place.

Luckily, Vim has commands that help us. Recall that `di"` deletes inside the current quoted content. `ci"` will also delete inside the current quoted content, but it'll drop you into insert mode straight afterwards. So, you can type `ci"`, then just start typing the replacement text.

The mnemonic here is "**c**hange **i**nside _something_"

Of course, this works for brackets, braces, and square brackets too. Give it a try in the editor!
