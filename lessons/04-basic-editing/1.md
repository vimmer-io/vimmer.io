# Inserting text

Some might argue that inserting text doesn't quality as an edit. I'd argue that it's the _most_ primitive edit there is! After all, what good is a text editor if we can't use it to _write_ stuff?

We've already learned how to insert text in a previous lesson, but let's quickly recap:

- use the `i` key to enter insert mode
- type something
- use the escape key to leave insert mode and re-enter normal mode

Let's combine this with our new knowledge of Vim navigation to write our name at the specified place in the editor.
