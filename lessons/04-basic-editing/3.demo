DELETE ME     This is a line. It's not just any line, though -- it's a line that was designed
  KEEP ME     to be deleted. Or was it? I can't tell. It really depends on what the text at
DELETE ME     the start of the column says.
DELETE ME     In any case, I'm not stopping you. Delete as many lines as you
  KEEP ME     want. Nothing bad is going to happen.
DELETE ME     Hopefully.
