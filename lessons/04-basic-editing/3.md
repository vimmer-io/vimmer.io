# Deleting lines

Deleting lines is another useful tool to have under your belt. If you are a software engineer, there's no doubt that you'll use this one all the time.

Deleting a single line in Vim can be done with the `dd` command in normal mode. Once again, you can use a count — like `10dd` — to delete multiple lines at the same time.

In the editor, try deleting all of the lines that start with `DELETE ME`.

## An extra bit for the curious

Try deleting a line, then move your cursor to another line, and hit `p` (all in normal mode). You'll notice that the last line you deleted has been inserted on the line below! This is because Vim stores the last deleted line in something called a register. The `p` command in normal mode is for "putting"/"pasting" the contents of a register.

Using this, see if you can take a line and move it elsewhere.
