# Closing tabpages

You can close a tabpage by:

- closing all of the windows within it, or
- using the `:tabclose` command

If you close all of the windows in a tabpage, the tabpage itself is closed — pretty intuitive.

You can also use the `:tabclose` command. `:tabclose` by itself will close the current tabpage, and `:[count]tabclose` — e.g. `:2tabclose` — can be used to close a tabpage by its number.

**Try it!** Open a bunch of tabpages in the editor and try closing them with `:tabclose`.
