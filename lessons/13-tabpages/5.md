# Reshuffling tabpages

If you want to rearrange your tabpages, use the `:tabmove` command.

- `:tabmove` by itself will move the current tabpage to the end of the tabline
- `:tabmove -1` will move the current tabpage one space to the left
- `:tabmove +1` will move the current tabpage one space to the right

If you find yourself doing this often, you might want to add a mapping for `:tabmove +1` and `:tabmove -1` to your Vim configuration.

**Try these in the editor.** There's three text files on disk: `foo.txt`, `bar.txt`, and `baz.txt`. Open each of them in a new tabpage with `:args *.txt` followed by `:tab all`. Then, experiment with the `:tabmove` command!
