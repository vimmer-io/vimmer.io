# Other ways to create new tabpages

`:tabnew` creates a tab with a new, blank file opened. You can also use `:tabedit` — much in the same way as you would use `:edit` — to open a file in a new tab.

But here's a really useful trick: if you prefix any command that would ordinarily open a new _window_ with the `:tab` command, it'll open that window as a _new tabpage instead_. For instance:

- the `:split` command opens a new horizontally split window peering into the same buffer
- the `:tab split` command therefore opens a new _tabpage_ whose window is peering into the same buffer

That particular command — `:tab sp` — is really handy. It lets you "zoom in" on a singular window by opening it in a new tabpage. I use this to "break flow" and wander off somewhere else in a project, safe in the knowledge that I can return to my previous tabpage later.

**Let's try these in the editor.** There are a few files on disk, called `dog.txt`, `cat.txt`, and `mouse.txt`. First, try opening them in new tabpages with the `:tabedit` command. For example: to open `cat.txt` in a new tabpage, you'll want to write `:tabedit cat.txt`.

Once you're used to the `:tabedit` command, let's experiment with `:tab sp`. In your current tabpage, run `:args *.txt` followed by `:all` to open all of the `*.txt` files in a new split. Then, move your cursor to any of the splits and run `:tab sp`. You should see the window be "broken out" into its own tabpage!
