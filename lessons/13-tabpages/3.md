# Moving between tabpages

We've just learned how to create new tabpages. But that's not much use without knowing how to move between them!

Moving between tabpages is really easy in Vim. You can use:

- `gt` to go to the _next_ tabpage
- `gT` to go to the _previous_ tabpage
- `[count]gt` to go to the `[count]`'th tabpage â€” e.g. `2gt` takes you to tabpage number 2

**Let's try this in the editor.** Like before, open 4 or 5 new tabpages with the `:tabnew` command. For each new tabpage, write something distinctive inside the buffer. Then, try switching between them with `gt`, `gT`, and `[count]gt`. As you move through them, you'll notice that the highlighting on the tabline at the top changes to reflect which tabpage you're currently on.
