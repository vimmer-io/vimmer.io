# Fundamentals of mapping with Vim

At a fundamental level, remapping with Vim is just saying "whenever these keys are typed, pretend that I typed these other keys instead". So, the following mapping from earlier:

    :inoremap ' ''<left>

is really just saying "whenever I type a `'`, pretend that I typed `''`, followed by the left arrow key".

## Mapping in different modes

You can create maps for any Vim mode â€” the available mapping commands are:

- `:map` for mapping in normal mode, visual mode, select mode, and operator pending mode all at once
- `:nmap` for mapping in normal mode
- `:vmap` for mapping in visual mode and select mode at the same time
- `:smap` for mapping in select mode
- `:xmap` for mapping in visual mode
- `:omap` for mapping in operator pending mode
- `:imap` for mapping in insert mode
- `:cmap` for mapping in command-line mode
- `:tmap` for mapping in Vim's built-in terminal

**Let's try this.** Try defining a normal mode map and an insert mode map (`:nmap`/`:nnoremap` and `:imap`/`:inoremap`) in the editor, then try using them.

## What does `noremap` mean?

`noremap` means "don't try to recursively execute this map". Consider the mapping from earlier:

    :inoremap ' ''<left>

If we didn't have `noremap` here and instead used:

    :imap ' ''<left>

Then, when you type `'`, Vim would try to _recursively_ look up the mapping for the `'` character, causing Vim to hang. `noremap` squashes this behaviour. If in doubt, you probably want to be using `noremap`!
