Try defining a normal mode map and an insert mode map with :nmap or :nnoremap, and
:imap or :inoremap, then try using them.


A good example for a normal mode map might be

    nnoremap <cr> gg

which makes the enter key jump to the top of the file.


A good example for an insert mode map might be;

    inoremap <space><space> .<space>

which lets you type two spaces to enter a period.
