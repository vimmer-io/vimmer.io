# The jumplist works across files

The great thing about the jumplist is that it works across files. If you're a programmer, this is really useful if you're using some kind of jump-to-definition plugin â€” you can jump, then return back using `<C-o>`.

**Let's try it in the editor**. Jump around in the file again, and when you're done open up the `other.txt` file with `:e other.txt`. Jump around in there too. Once you've had enough, use `<C-o>` and `<C-i>` as before to traverse the jumplist. You'll notice that the jumplist works across files!
