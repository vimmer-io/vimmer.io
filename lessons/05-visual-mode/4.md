# What can I do with visual mode?

We've now learned how to use the different variants of visual mode to select a region of text. But what can we actually _do_ with it? So far we've only deleted regions of text — but there's more we can do.

You can use the following key maps in visual mode:

- `x` or `d` to delete
- `c` to change — i.e. deleting your entire selection, then dropping you into insert mode
- `y` to "yank" — this is similar to copying to the clipboard, and we'll learn more about this in the next lesson
- `>` to indent forward
- `<` to indent backwards

**Give it a try in the editor.** Don't feel like you need to try yanking for now, though; we're going to learn about that soon.
