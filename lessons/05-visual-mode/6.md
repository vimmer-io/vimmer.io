# Reselecting the last visual region

You might start a visual selection over some text, and accidentally hit the wrong key, dropping you back into normal mode with no text selected. Mistakes happen!

But fret not: Vim remembers your last visual selection, so if you back out of visual mode for any reason, you can easily get back to where you were.

The mapping for this is `gv` in normal mode.

**Give it a try in the editor**. Visually select a region, then back out of visual mode by hitting escape. You can recover the selected region by hitting `gv` in normal mode.
