Try experiment with the o keymap in visual mode below:

    This is some example text for you to play with. Try selecting a region in
    visual mode, then using the o key to jump to the other end. You'll notice
    that it's possible to expand and contract your selection from both ends!
    You can't do this with regular highlighting in other editors, which is
    another reason why Vim is great.
