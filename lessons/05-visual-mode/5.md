# Changing the visual area

When you're in any of the visual mode variants, you can use the `o` key to jump the cursor to the other end of the highlighted text. Remember this one, because it's really handy! It means that the position you _started_ visual mode in isn't fixed.

For example, if you start visual mode and realise that you've chosen the wrong start position, you don't have to exit visual mode and re-select a new region. You can just hit the `o` key, move the start of the region to where you want, and then hit the `o` key again.

**Give it a try in the editor**. Enter visual mode, then experiment with the `o` key. You'll see that it's actually possible to change your visual selection in both directions!
