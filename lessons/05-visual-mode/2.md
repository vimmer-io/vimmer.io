# Visual line mode

Most of the time — especially if you're a programmer — you'll want to select lines rather than individual characters. In these situations, visual line mode comes in handy. It works in the same way as visual mode, but on a line-by-line basis.

To enter visual line mode, hit `V` in the editor. You'll notice that navigations that move the cursor left and right have no affect on the region that's selected (but they still move the cursor).

**Give it a try in the editor**. This time, delete all of the _lines_ that are filled with `?` characters. The key maps in visual line mode are the same as in visual mode, so use `x` to delete.
