Try out the keymaps on the text below:

    This is a paragraph. It consists of four sentences. You can select a single
    sentence with vis, and the entire paragraph with vip. Pretty useful if you
    ask me!

    "This is a quoted string. Try selecting the contents of these quotes!"

    {
        // This is a code block. Try selecting everything within this
        // codeblock!
        print("Hello world.");
    }
