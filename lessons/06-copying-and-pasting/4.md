# The unnamed register

When you yank with Vim, it doesn't copy the text to your system's clipboard (by default). Instead, it copies the text into a _register_. A register is just a storage location for text — like your system clipboard, but living within Vim. Vim has many registers, and each one has a unique identifier that we use to reference it.

Let's not think about the different registers just yet, though. Most of the time, when we're yanking/putting in Vim, we don't even specify a register. In this situation, Vim will use the _unnamed register_, which you can think of as the default.

Something that's particularly noteworthy is that the unnamed register gets modified when we're doing _deletions_ and _changes_ (with `d`, `c`, `x`, etc) — not just when we're yanking!

What does this mean? _Deleting_ some text is the same as yanking it, and _then_ deleting it. This is unintuitive at first, because it means that the text you just yanked can be overwritten by a delete. But it's actually really useful; most of the time, you're not _deleting_ something, you just want to move it somewhere else.

**Give it a try in the editor.** Delete the first paragraph with `dap`, then navigate to the bottom of the file and put it with `p`. This feature is super useful for rearranging paragraphs, sentences, and code blocks.
