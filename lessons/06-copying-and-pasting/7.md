# The number registers

We now know that `"0` stores the contents of the last yank. So, what about registers 1 through 9?

Vim uses these registers to store the contents of the last _deletions_. This is incredibly useful for recovering previously deleted text.

`"1` contains the text deleted by the most recent delete or change command (unless the command specified another register _or_ the text is less than one line). With each subsequent deletion or change, Vim will shifts contents of `"1` into `"2`, `"2` into `"3`, and so on. The contents of `"9` are then lost.

In practice, this means the text from your recent deletions are stored across the number registers, with the _most recent_ deletion being stored in `"1` and the _oldest_ deletion being stored in `"9`. So even text that you deleted from a while ago isn't fully gone!

**Try this in the editor.** Delete the lines, and then examine the contents of the numbered registers with the `:reg` command. You should see that the lines you deleted first are in the higher number registers.

Of course, you can recover and of the deleted lines by using, for example, `"3p`.
