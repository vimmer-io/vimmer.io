# Yanking and putting lines

In Vim, there are two keys to remember — `y` for yanking, and `p` for putting. We're going to explore a number of ways to use the `y` and `p` keys in this lesson, but to kick us off, let's try one of the simplest yank/put sequences possible: yanking a line with `yy` and then putting it into the buffer with `p`.

**Give it a go in the editor.** `yy` yanks the current line under the cursor. `p` will then put the yanked text onto the next line. You only need to yank the text _once_, then you can put it as many times as you like.

(**Note:** both `yy` and `p` accept counts — if you're feeling adventurous, you can yank the line, then put it 5 times with `5p`!)
