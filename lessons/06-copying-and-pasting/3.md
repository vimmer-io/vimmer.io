# Yanking in visual mode

You can precisely specify the text you want to yank by entering visual mode, highlighting the region you want to yank, then hitting `y`. You can then use `p` to put it like normal.

**Give it a go in the editor.** Highlight a region of text, yank it, then put it at the bottom of the file.
