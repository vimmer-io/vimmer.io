# The zero register

Vim also has registers for the numbers, 0 through 9. These are managed by Vim, and are filled with text from the yank and delete commands.

In this section, we're going to focus on the `"0` register. This register is particularly special because it always contains the text from the _most recent yank command_ (unless that yank command used a specific register).

This is useful because, if you recall, the default register is populated with the contents of _deletions_ and _changes_ too. As a consequence, it's very easy to accidentally overwrite the text in the default register by accident.

In practice, this means that you can use `"0p` to put the _last text you yanked_, no matter how many deletions and changes happened afterwards. `"0` is only ever written to when you yank, so you don't have to worry about deletes and changes overwriting its contents.

**Try this in the editor.** Yank the first line, and then delete the subsequent lines with `dd`. Then, try putting from the `"0` register with `"0p`. The output should be line that you initially copied.
