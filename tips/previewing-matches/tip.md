You can use `<C-g>` and `<C-t>` to move to the next and previous match respectively whilst you are searching with `/` or `?`. This is useful because it allows you to preview your matches before you commit to them. It also means that your cursor never moves from its current position — so if you want to take a look around the file and immediately return back to where you are, the `<C-g>` and `<C-t>` keys are one way to do it.

**Try it in the editor** — start a search for the word foo with `/foo`, then try hitting `<C-g>` and `<C-t>` to move around the matches.
