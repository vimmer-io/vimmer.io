This is a test document for you to practice completion in.

In insert mode, start typing a word and then hit <C-n>. This will reveal a
completion popup. You can cycle through the options with <C-n> and <C-p> to
move forward and backward respectively.

Since this buffer is the only buffer open, completion will only search for
words inside this buffer.
