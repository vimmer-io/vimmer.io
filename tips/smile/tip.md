If you're ever feeling down, Vim just the thing for you. There's a small Easter egg that you can access with the `:smile` command.

**Give it a try in the editor.**

"Why is this a thing?", you might ask. Well, your guess is about as good as mine! I'd imagine it was added just for fun.

If you're on Neovim, `:smile` does something slightly different â€” if you have `nvim` installed, make sure you give that a try too.
