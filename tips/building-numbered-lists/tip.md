You might already know about `<C-a>` and `<C-x>` in Vim, which allow you to increment or decrement the number under the cursor respectively.

You can take this behaviour even further with `g<C-a>` and `g<C-x>`, which can be used to create ascending or descending lists of numbers.

**It's best to learn this one by example, so let's try it.** In the editor, select all of the `0` lines with visual mode, then hit `g<C-a>`.
