`g?` in Vim is the ROT13 operator. It allows you to encoded the specified text with the [ROT13 cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).

For example, you can use `g?ip` in normal mode to ROT13 encode the paragraph under the cursor.

We'll be honest â€” we're not entirely sure what this would ever be useful for. It's more of a fun easter egg.
