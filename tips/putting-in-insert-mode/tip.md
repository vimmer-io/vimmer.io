You can put a register directly from insert mode with `<C-r>` followed by the register name in Vim. For example, to put the anonymous register in insert mode, you'd type `<C-r>"`.

**Try it in the editor** â€” delete a word from the first sentence, then enter insert mode in the second sentence and hit `<C-r>"` to put it.
