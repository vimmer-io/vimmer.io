Use `J` in normal mode to join the current line that the cursor is on with the line below.

You can also use `J` in visual mode to join all of the selected lines onto a single line.

The same operation can be done from the command line with the `:join` command, which can be especially useful when combined with the [global command](https://vimmer.io/lesson/the-insane-power-of-vims-global-command).

**Try it in the editor** â€” combine the paragraphs onto a single line using the `J` key in normal and visual mode. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also experiment with the `:join` Ex command!
