Vim has a mode for _replacing_ text, aptly called _replace mode_.

Replace mode works like insert mode, but instead of adding new characters, it replaces existing characters under the cursor. Sometimes, this is a faster way to change some text â€” if the new text is the same length as the old text, you don't have to delete it first!

To enter replace mode, press `R` in normal mode. Any characters you type will replace the characters underneath the cursor.

**Give this a try in the editor.** Try changing `James` to `Peter` using replace mode!
