You can use the `H`, `M`, and `L` keys to move the cursor to the high, middle, and low parts of the current window vertically. These are sometimes useful if you want your cursor to be _somewhere_ in the general area of the top, middle, or bottom of the view.

**Try it in the editor.** `H` takes you to the very first visible line, `M` moves your cursor to the dead-center vertically, and `L` takes you to the very last visible line.
