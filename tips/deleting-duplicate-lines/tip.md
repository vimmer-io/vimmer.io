Let's say you have a set of lines and you want to remove all of the duplicated lines.

You can do this in Vim by visually selecting the lines, then using the `:sort u` command.

`:sort` is an Ex command used for sorting the line range â€” the `u` flag tells it to remove duplicates.

**Try it in the editor!**
