You can switch the case of the character under the cursor with `~` in normal mode.

You can also use `~` in visual mode to switch the case of the selected characters.

Finally, you can use `g~` as an operator for switching case â€” meaning you can do things like `g~ip` to switch the case inside an entire paragraph.
