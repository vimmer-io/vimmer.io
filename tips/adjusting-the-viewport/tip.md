You can just the viewport on the screen relative to your cursor with `zz`, `zt`, and `zb`.

`zz` adjusts your viewport such that the cursor is central on the screen vertically.

`zt` adjusts your viewport such that the cursor is at the top of the screen vertically.

`zb` adjusts your viewport such that the cursor is at the bottom of the screen vertically.

These are useful when you want to keep your cursor in the same spot, but shift the view into the document to see more text.

**Try it in the editor!**
