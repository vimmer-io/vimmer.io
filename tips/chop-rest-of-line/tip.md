You can chop the rest of the line off with the `D` key in normal mode. This deletes the rest of the line starting from the character under the cursor.

You can also use the `C` key to _change_ until the end of the line. This works exactly the same as `D`, but it drops you into insert mode after making the deletion.

**Try it in the editor.** On line 5, use the `D` command to delete the quoted text from the end of the line. Then, on line 10, use the `C` command to change the name after the colon to your own name.
