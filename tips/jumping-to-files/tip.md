Vim lets you jump to the filename under the cursor with the `gf` keymap in normal mode. The mnemonic for this is 'go to file'.

**Let's try this in the editor.** The editor is pre-populated with a few files that you can jump between. With your cursor on (or before) a file path, hit `gf`. It'll jump you directly to the file!
